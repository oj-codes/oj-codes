# Hi, I’m O.J. — SRE • Educator • Builder of calm systems

> I build reliable, scalable systems and the feedback loops that keep them healthy.

I’m a Senior SRE / platform‑leaning engineer who thrives where software, IaC, and automation meet: Terraform-driven environments, reusable CI/CD pipelines, and observability that turns signals into decisions. I mentor early‑career engineers and write about practical reliability. Currently open to senior SRE roles and selective consulting while I complete my B.S. in Computer Science.

## 🔧 Today I’m working on

- **Platform reliability:** containerized app platforms, golden paths, and paved‑road tooling
- **Observability:** SLO‑minded dashboards/alerts that reduce blind spots and shorten MTTR
- **Infra as Code:** modular Terraform, GitOps flows, and guardrails that scale with teams
- **Learning/teaching:** building study labs and mentoring new engineers entering SRE

---

## 💡 Recent highlights

- Drove a **multi‑region cloud migration** and improved deployment flow with CI/CD
- Built **actionable dashboards** that made latency & errors obvious to teams
- Shipped **test automation** that increased confidence in releases

> Ask me about: pragmatic reliability, software engineering, platform engineering, and helping juniors level up.

## 🛠️ Toolbox

**Cloud:** AWS · GCP · Azure 
**Infra:** Terraform · Helm · Kubernetes · Docker  
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions · ArgoCD · GitLab CI  
**Obs.:** Grafana · Prometheus · OpenTelemetry  
**Langs:** Python · Go · Bash · TypeScript · NodeJS
**DX/Testing:** Playwright · pytest · k6 · Make · pre-commit

> I’m cloud‑agnostic with a preference for AWS and GCP.
